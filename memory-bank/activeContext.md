# Active Context - Recruitment Account Management System

## Current Work Focus

### Recent Analysis Completed
- **Project Overview**: Comprehensive analysis of the Recruitment codebase
- **Architecture Review**: Understanding of React + TypeScript + Supabase stack
- **AI Integration**: Analysis of OpenRouter API and email tuning services
- **Database Schema**: Review of Supabase database structure
- **Component Structure**: Understanding of shadcn/ui and component organization
- **Portfolio Conversion**: Replaced n8n webhook dependencies with mock system

### Current State Assessment
The project is in a **production-ready and deployed state** with:
- âœ… Complete authentication system (email/password + Google OAuth)
- âœ… Candidate submission workflow
- âœ… Client list management system
- âœ… AI-powered email generation and tuning
- âœ… Mock webhook system for portfolio demonstration
- âœ… Responsive UI with dark/light theme support
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- âœ… **Live deployment at https://recruitment.npav.dev/**
- âœ… **Custom domain configuration with Vercel**
- âœ… **Updated branding and contact information**

## Next Steps & Priorities

### Immediate Focus Areas
1. **Memory Bank Setup**: Complete documentation of project patterns and context
2. **Code Quality Review**: Ensure all components follow established patterns
3. **Performance Optimization**: Review and optimize bundle size and loading times
4. **Error Handling Enhancement**: Strengthen error boundaries and user feedback

### Potential Improvements
1. **Testing Implementation**: Add unit and integration tests
2. **Documentation**: Enhance inline documentation and README
3. **Accessibility**: Audit and improve WCAG compliance
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance tracking and analytics

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Component Architecture**: Using kebab-case naming convention
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, Context for auth
- **Styling Approach**: TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components
- **AI Integration**: OpenRouter API with fallback mechanisms

### Design Patterns in Use
- **Server Components**: Preferring React Server Components where possible
- **Client Components**: Minimizing 'use client' usage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Current Challenges

### Identified Areas for Improvement
1. **Code Duplication**: Some repeated patterns in component structure
2. **Error Handling**: Could be more consistent across components
3. **Loading States**: Some components lack proper loading indicators
4. **Type Safety**: Some areas could benefit from stricter TypeScript

### Technical Debt
- **Component Organization**: Some components could be better organized
- **Hook Extraction**: Some logic could be extracted into custom hooks
- **Performance**: Some components could be optimized for better performance
